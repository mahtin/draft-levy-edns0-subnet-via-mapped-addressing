               EDNS0 Client Subnet Via Mapped Addressing
            draft-levy-edns0-subnet-via-mapped-addressing-00

Abstract

   This document proposes a new optional mapping for the ADDRESS field
   in an EDNS0 Client Subnet (ECS).

   Presently [RFC7871] simply states: "To protect users' privacy,
   Recursive Resolvers are strongly encouraged to conceal part of the
   user's IP address by truncating IPv4 addresses to 24 bits. 56 bits
   are recommended for IPv6, based on RFC6177."

   This RFC proposes that an IPv6 block is allocated and within that
   block a fixed mapping is published that maps geography to an IPv6
   address.  The resolver then send this new IPv6 address within the
   ADDRESS field of an existing ECS record.

   No new EDNS0 record type is created.

1.  Introduction

   In [RFC7871], the EDNS0 Client Subnet (ECS) method roughly exposes
   the clients network address by using a /24 or /56 mask.  The ADDRESS
   field still contains a routable portion of the clients IP address;
   hence, some privacy information is somewhat exposed.  For
   IPv6-enabled clients, it may still be a one-to-one mapping, even with
   a /56 mask.  See [RFC6177].

   Without changing the ECS protcol or it's operational usage, it's
   possible to provide the client far more privacy by mapping the users
   geography to a fresh IP address (an IPv6 address that's not routed
   globally) which is then placed in the ADDRESS field within ann ECS
   message.

   The mapping should be published and agreed too ahead of time.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  The existing EDNS0 Client Subnet

   Blah Blah ... describe how this works today.

3.  The masked EDNS0 Client Subnet

   We propose to ...  blah blah blah ... map IPs based on client.  New
   IP address is based on geolocation codes (UNLOC [UNLOC], IATA codes
   [IATA], or some other method.

4.  Examples

   The ADDRESS field would be mapped from the client's IP address via a
   geocoded module.

   +------+------+------+------+------+------+
   | 0053 | #### | #### | #### | #### | #### |
   +------+------+------+------+------+------+

        An ADDRESS field created from a fixed geolocation database.

                                 Figure 1

   The ADDRESS field would be a /56 in order to be compatible with
   [RFC7871].

Internet-Draft             ECS Mapped Address                 April 2018


   Using an IPv6 address (which is not routed and has many bits to play
   with) is simply a way of allowing existing ECS software to continue
   to operate without new protocols being created (or implemented).

5.  Acknowledgements

   This work is based on the privacy needs of the Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1
   Resolver [Cloudflare1111] operated by Cloudflare [Cloudflare].  In
   addition, this work was inspired by the work of the Google Public DNS
   [Google8888] service.

6.  IANA Considerations

   Because this draft defines a new IPv6 block, this document includes a
   request to IANA.

   The 0053::/16 block is requested from IANA (or IETF?) from the
   0000::/8 block which is maintained at
   <https://www.iana.org/assignments/ipv6-address-space/ipv6-address-
   space.xhtml> and reserved for IETF usage.

   This block will not be routed.  It is used to hold 128 bits of
   information.

7.  Security Considerations

   This proposal, by its very nature, exposes the existence and general
   geography of a source client; however, not the actual client IP or
   their subnet.
