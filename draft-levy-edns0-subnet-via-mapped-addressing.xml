   <abstract>
     <t>
This document proposes a new optional mapping for the ADDRESS field in an EDNS0 Client Subnet (ECS).
     </t>

     <t>
Presently <xref target="RFC7871"/> simply states:
"To protect users' privacy, Recursive Resolvers are strongly
encouraged to conceal part of the user's IP address by truncating
IPv4 addresses to 24 bits. 56 bits are recommended for IPv6, based on
RFC6177."
     </t>

     <t>
This RFC proposes that an IPv6 block is allocated and within that block a fixed mapping is published
that maps geography to an IPv6 address.
The resolver then send this new IPv6 address within the ADDRESS field of an existing ECS record.
     </t>

     <t>
The goal is simple. Never return the IP (or IP block) of the client; but instead map the 
location (which the resolver calculates from the client IP) into a meta-IP address. 
Meanwhile, there exists a table that's public (and distributed to geolocation companies 
and users) which maps this meta-IP to a location.
     </t>

     <t>
The 0053::/16 block is requested in order to implement this draft.
     </t>

     <t>
No new EDNS0 record type is created. No protocol change is requested.
     </t>

   <section title="Introduction">

     <t>
In <xref target="RFC7871"/>, the EDNS0 Client Subnet (ECS) method roughly exposes the clients network address by using a /24 or /56 mask.
The ADDRESS field still contains a routable portion of the clients IP address; hence, some privacy information is somewhat exposed.
For IPv6-enabled clients, it may still be a one-to-one mapping, even with a /56 mask. See <xref target="RFC6177"/>.
     </t>

     <t>
Without changing the ECS protcol or it's operational usage, it's possible to provide the client far more privacy by mapping the users geography
to a fresh IP address (an IPv6 address that's not routed globally) which is then placed in the ADDRESS field within ann ECS message.
     </t>

     <t>
The mapping should be published and agreed too ahead of time.
     </t>

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.

We propose to ...

New IP address is based on geolocation codes (<xref target="UNLOC">UNLOC</xref>, <xref target="IATA">IATA codes</xref>,
or some other method.
     </t>

   </section>

   <section title="Examples">
     <t>
The ADDRESS field would be mapped from the client's IP address via a geocoded module in the resolver.

The FAMILY should be the value for IPv6 (i.e. 2).
The SOURCE PREFIX-LENGTH should be 56.
The ADDRESS field would be a /56 address in order to be compatible with <xref target="RFC7871"/>.

     <t>
Using an IPv6 address (which is not routed and has many bits to play with) is simply a way
of allowing existing ECS software to continue to operate without new protocols being created (or implemented).
     </t>

     <t>
If the authorative DNS does not have a geolocatation database for the IPv6 block; then it's no different than
any new network that shows up on the Internet.
Resolving this issue is out-of-scope for this draft.

This work is based on the privacy needs of the <xref target="Cloudflare1111">Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1 Resolver</xref>

In addition, this work was inspired by the work of the <xref target="Google8888">Google Public DNS</xref> service
and their struggles with ECS.

   <section title="IANA Considerations" anchor="IANA">

     <t>
Because this draft defines a new IPv6 block, this document includes a request to IANA.
     </t>

     <t>
The 0053::/16 block is requested from IANA (or IETF?) from the 0000::/8 block which is
maintained at <eref target="https://www.iana.org/assignments/ipv6-address-space/ipv6-address-space.xhtml"/>
and reserved for IETF usage.
     </t>

     <t>
This block will not be routed. It is used to hold 128 bits of information.

   <section title="Security Considerations" anchor="Security">
     <t>
This proposal, by its very nature, exposes the existence and general geography of a source client;
however, not the actual client IP or their subnet.
